# Image Processing Masterclass with Python

50+ Solutions and Techniques Solving Complex Digital Image Processing Challenges Using Numpy, Scipy, Pytorch and Keras

This is the code repository for [Image Processing Masterclass with Python](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/image-processing-masterclass-with-python?_pos=1&_sid=4b59a7d63&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book

## About the Book
This book starts with basic Image Processing and manipulation problems and demonstrates how to solve them with popular Python libraries and modules. It then concentrates on problems based on Geometric image transformations and problems to be solved with Image hashing. 
Next, the book focuses on solving problems based on Sampling, Convolution, Discrete Fourier transform, Frequency domain filtering and image restoration with deconvolution. It also aims at solving Image enhancement problems using different  algorithms such as spatial filters and create a super resolution image using SRGAN.
Finally, it explores popular facial image processing problems and solves them with Machine learning and Deep learning models using popular python ML / DL libraries.
